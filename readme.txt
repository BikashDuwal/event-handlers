Introduction to browser events
An event is a signal that something has happened. All DOM nodes generate such signals (but events are not limited to DOM).

Here’s a list of the most useful DOM events, just to take a look at:

Mouse events:

click – when the mouse clicks on an element (touchscreen devices generate it on a tap).
contextmenu – when the mouse right-clicks on an element.
mouseover / mouseout – when the mouse cursor comes over / leaves an element.
mousedown / mouseup – when the mouse button is pressed / released over an element.
mousemove – when the mouse is moved.
Keyboard events:

keydown and keyup – when a keyboard key is pressed and released.
Form element events:

submit – when the visitor submits a <form>.
focus – when the visitor focuses on an element, e.g. on an <input>.
Document events:

DOMContentLoaded – when the HTML is loaded and processed, DOM is fully built.
CSS events:

transitionend – when a CSS-animation finishes.
There are many other events. We’ll get into more details of particular events in upcoming chapters. 

In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, and JavaScript can respond to these events. Here are some of the most common types of events in JavaScript:

### 1. **Mouse Events**
   - **`click`**: Triggered when an element is clicked.
   - **`dblclick`**: Triggered when an element is double-clicked.
   - **`mousedown`**: Triggered when the mouse button is pressed down on an element.
   - **`mouseup`**: Triggered when the mouse button is released over an element.
   - **`mousemove`**: Triggered when the mouse is moved over an element.
   - **`mouseenter`**: Triggered when the mouse pointer enters an element.
   - **`mouseleave`**: Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
   - **`mouseover`**: Triggered when the mouse pointer hovers over an element.
   - **`mouseout`**: Triggered when the mouse pointer moves out of an element.

### 2. **Keyboard Events**
   - **`keydown`**: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
   - **`keyup`**: Triggered when a key is released.
   - **`keypress`**: Triggered when a key is pressed (now largely replaced by `keydown`/`keyup`).

### 3. **Form Events**
   - **`submit`**: Triggered when a form is submitted.
   - **`change`**: Triggered when an input element (e.g., `input`, `select`, `textarea`) changes value.
   - **`focus`**: Triggered when an element gains focus.
   - **`blur`**: Triggered when an element loses focus.
   - **`input`**: Triggered whenever the value of an `input` or `textarea` changes.

### 4. **Touch Events (Mobile/Touch Devices)**
   - **`touchstart`**: Triggered when a touch is initiated.
   - **`touchmove`**: Triggered when a touch is moved along the screen.
   - **`touchend`**: Triggered when a touch ends.
   - **`touchcancel`**: Triggered when a touch event is interrupted (e.g., when a phone call comes in).

### 5. **Window Events**
   - **`load`**: Triggered when the entire page has loaded (including images, scripts, etc.).
   - **`resize`**: Triggered when the browser window is resized.
   - **`scroll`**: Triggered when the user scrolls the page.
   - **`unload`**: Triggered when the page is being unloaded (e.g., closing a tab).
   - **`beforeunload`**: Triggered before the page is unloaded, allowing the user to save changes.

### 6. **Clipboard Events**
   - **`copy`**: Triggered when content is copied.
   - **`cut`**: Triggered when content is cut.
   - **`paste`**: Triggered when content is pasted.

### 7. **Drag and Drop Events**
   - **`dragstart`**: Triggered when the user starts dragging an element.
   - **`drag`**: Triggered while the element is being dragged.
   - **`dragover`**: Triggered when the dragged element is over a drop target.
   - **`drop`**: Triggered when the dragged element is dropped.
   - **`dragend`**: Triggered when the dragging operation ends.

### 8. **Media Events**
   - **`play`**: Triggered when media (audio/video) starts playing.
   - **`pause`**: Triggered when media is paused.
   - **`ended`**: Triggered when media reaches the end.
   - **`timeupdate`**: Triggered when the current playback position changes.
   - **`volumechange`**: Triggered when the volume is changed.

### 9. **Miscellaneous Events**
   - **`contextmenu`**: Triggered when the right mouse button is clicked to open a context menu.
   - **`error`**: Triggered when an error occurs (e.g., when an image fails to load).
   - **`animationstart`**, **`animationend`**, **`animationiteration`**: Triggered during CSS animations.
   - **`transitionstart`**, **`transitionend`**: Triggered during CSS transitions.

These event types cover most of the common interactions with web pages, and you can attach event listeners to them to execute custom JavaScript code.

you cannot directly reassign values to the properties of the getBoundingClientRect() object. The getBoundingClientRect() method returns a read-only object that represents the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.

You cannot modify properties like left, top, width, or height on this object. Instead, to manipulate the position of an element, you need to modify the element’s CSS properties (e.g., style.left, style.top, style.width, etc.).

Example:
If you want to move an element to a different position, you cannot do this:

javascript
Copy code
let rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
rect.left = 100; // This won't work! It's a read-only property.
Instead, you modify the position by setting the CSS style properties:

javascript
Copy code
element.style.left = '100px'; // This works to move the element.
Correct Usage:
To move an element using its current position from getBoundingClientRect(), you can calculate the new values and then apply them using style:

javascript
Copy code
const element = document.getElementById('ball');
const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();

// Calculate new position (e.g., move 20px to the right and 20px down)
const newLeft = rect.left + 20;
const newTop = rect.top + 20;

// Apply the new position via CSS
element.style.left = newLeft + 'px';
element.style.top = newTop + 'px';
In summary:

getBoundingClientRect() provides information but is read-only.
To change the position, use CSS properties such as style.left and style.top.
